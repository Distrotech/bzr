Release notes for Bazaar-NG (pre-0)

mbp@sourcefrog.net, November 2004, London


* There is little locking or transaction control here; if you
  interrupt it the tree may be arbitrarily broken.  This will be
  fixed.

* Don't use this for critical data; at the very least keep separate
  regular snapshots of your tree.


Dependencies
------------

This is mostly developed on Linux (Ubuntu); it should work on Unix,
Windows, or OS X with relatively little trouble.

bzr requires a fairly recent Python, say after 2.2.  

You can improve performance by installing Fredrik Lundh's amazing
cElementTree__ module.
