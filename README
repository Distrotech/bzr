Caveats
-------


* There is little locking or transaction control here; if you
  interrupt it the tree may be arbitrarily broken.  This will be
  fixed.

* Don't use this for critical data; at the very least keep separate
  regular snapshots of your tree.


Dependencies
------------

This is mostly developed on Linux (Ubuntu); it should work on Unix,
Windows, or OS X with relatively little trouble.

bzr requires a fairly recent Python, say after 2.2.  2.4 is recommended.

You must install either cElementTree_ or ElementTree_ first.

Installation
------------

The best way to install bzr is to symlink the ``bzr`` command onto a
directory on your path.  For example::

  ln -s ~/work/bzr/bzr ~/bin/bzr

If you use a symlink for this, Python will be able to automatically
find the bzr libraries.  Otherwise you must ensure they are listed on
your $PYTHONPATH.
