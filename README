Release notes for Bazaar-NG 0.0.5

Caveats
-------



* Don't use this for critical data; at the very least keep separate
  regular snapshots of your tree.


Dependencies
------------

This is mostly developed on Linux (Ubuntu); it should work on Unix,
Windows, or OS X with relatively little trouble.

The only dependency is Python, at least 2.3 and preferably 2.4.  

You may optionally install cElementTree to speed up some operations.


Installation
------------

The best way to install bzr is to symlink the ``bzr`` command onto a
directory on your path.  For example::

  ln -s ~/work/bzr/bzr ~/bin/bzr

If you use a symlink for this, Python will be able to automatically
find the bzr libraries.  Otherwise you must ensure they are listed on
your $PYTHONPATH.

After installing, please run the test suite to identify any problems
on your platform::

  ./testbzr

If you use the setup.py script then bzr will be installed into the
specified path.  In this case you must install ElementTree or
cElementTree separately.
