#compdef bzr

# Rudimentary zsh completion support for bzr.

# -S means there are no options after a -- and that argument is ignored

# To use this you must arrange for it to be in a directory that is on
# your $fpath, and also for compinit to be run.  I don't understand
# how to get zsh to reload this file when it changes, other than by
# starting a new zsh.

# This is not very useful at the moment because it only completes on
# commands and breaks filename expansion for other arguments.
