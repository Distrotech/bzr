Should be a simple command that shows something similar to 'svn
status':

  what is not added but perhaps should be
  what is source, backup, precious, junk, etc

Or a nice simple command like 'bk extras' to show what's not added but
should be.
  
baz inventory almost does this but it way too hard to understand
