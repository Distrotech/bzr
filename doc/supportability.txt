Bazaar-NG Supportability
************************

The goal is to be able to diagnose and fix a bug the first time it is
reported, even if the reporter or developer can't reproduce it.

Done:

* Verbose logs are always written to ``.bzr.log`` in the current
  directory.  This include all error messages and some trace messages
  that are not normally displayed.  It also includes backtraces if
  an exception occurs.

To do:

* The --verbose option should send debug output to stderr.

* Re-read changesets after writing them to a temporary file, but
  before permanently committing them.  Make sure that they are valid
  XML (against RELAX-NG schema), that they can be parsed, and that
  they recreate the right revision.  This should help prevent the
  archive ever getting corrupted, which is a pain to reverse.
