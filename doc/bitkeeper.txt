Bitkeeper compared to Arch
==========================

BK has a default GUI, which is good, but it's ugly and not all that
friendly to the new user.  It does pay attention to allowing quick
keyboard navigation.

The tool itself is also a bit unfriendly in terms of emitting a lot of
noise messages and having lots of wierd commands.

Bitkeeper always requires both per-file and per-changeset commands.
It seems bad to always require this; at most per-file messages should
be optional.  Are they really the best option?

Claimed to have extremely space-efficient storage, keeping 19 years of
history in slightly more than twice the size of the working copy. 

Hashes: does Baz always have these even without signing?  It really
should.

Fine-grained event triggers, pre- and post-event.

Can remotely find status of a tree, e.g. parent, number of comitters,
versioned files, extras, modified, etc.
