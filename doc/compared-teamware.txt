Compared to Sun Teamware
************************

(**note**: I have never used Sun Teamware, so this document is just
based on public documentation and information from other people.
Corrections would be appreciated.)

Needless to say bazaar-ng is currently far less mature, and some of
the advantages listed below don't work in the current pre-1.0 code.
But they are accounted for in the design.

TeamWare has file locking.  Distributed systems can't easily support
file locking because you can't prevent people diverging.  But perhaps
we can have scripts or a higher-level tool to communicate that changes
to a particular file are in train.  (One possibility: there is a
development branch where that file has been changed, but not yet
checked in.  Or if Bob can see Alice's work area, he can see that a
particular file has been fetched read/write.)

parent/child workspaces.

Advantages of bazaar-ng:

* Free / open source software

* Prior tree revisions are always exactly reproducible (atomic
  changesets, etc)

* Can get whole-tree diff

* Versioned, mergeable renames.
