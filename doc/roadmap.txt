Roadmap for Bazaar-NG
*********************

(This document contains only things still-to-do, in in approximate
order.  For a list of things already done, see the `development
news`__.)

__ news.html

* get doctest going again now that we have predictable-order status
  commands

* note at top of .bzr.log

* basic local versioning working: init, add, remove, mv, status, log,
  diff, commit, revert

  * revert command
  * mv command
  
* some commands should work on selected files, if any are given:

  * diff
  * status
  * log
  * commit

* work properly when invoked from a subdirectory

* give a file-id to tree root?

* use stat information to detect unchanged files without reading the
  full text (or establish that this is not safe).

* basic find command: find versioned, deleted, unknown, etc.

* branch command

* get a branch from an http server (remote Tree/Store/Branch proxy
  classes)

* write experimental weave algorithm in Python to see how it works?

* update command: pull in changes from another branch that is a strict
  superset of the destination

* merge command: reconcile changes in this branch with those in
  another.  punt on structural changes at first and only merge text,
  then work out a nice way to resolve structure.

* ``vc-bzr.el`` emacs support

* *go self-hosting at about this point*, with parallel commits to baz

* ignore patterns from ``.bzrignore``



longer-term things:

* Some kind of `compressed storage <compression.html>`_.
