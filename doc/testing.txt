Test plan for Patchflow
***********************

This should be amenable to good automated testing.  Here are some
ideas.

* Corrupt the branch in various ways and make sure it is detected.

  - To start with test all cases checked by check()

* Commit.


I'm using doctest_ for some API tests, and it looks pretty nice.  It
adds some documentation of the pre/post-conditions of various
operations.  It also encourages creating a clean and friendly Python
API.

Testing through the Python API does not cover all of the external
shell interface, but it is much easier to write, because we don't need
to deal with serializing everything to/from text.

We may need additional tests to this.
