Scalability
***********

bzr needs to scale up very well: projects with tens of thousands of
commits, tens of thousands of files, and tens of thousands of
branches.

We are concerned with both the big-O performance of the design, and
the multiplicative factors of the implementation.  Both is important.

For example, darcs, svn and arch use more than one inode per working
file (pristine, id file, etc).  This is only a constant factor, but
enough to more than double the space used by a typical tree.  We would
like to avoid it if we can.

From a early stage in development the features which do work should be
tested on large trees.
