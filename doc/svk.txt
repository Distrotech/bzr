svk

The strategic strength is that it can trivially and reliably
interoperate with upstream projects using Subversion.  This tends to
satisfy people who need disconnected operation, and so to allow
projects to feel safe about switching to Subversion.

On the other hand it may be a bit flaky in implementation; being
written in Perl on top of Svn bindings may not inspire confidence;
relatively little documentation.
