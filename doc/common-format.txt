***********************
Common changeset format
***********************

It might be useful to have a common changeset format for interchange
between projects.

It is not clear that you would be able to capture everything that
every tool produces, but perhaps a lot could be done.

Scenarios: (in order of difficulty?)

 * dump/load

 * convert repo from one tool to another

 * one-way sync from exotic tool into read-only CVS or Svn repo

 * two way sync between writable archives

Perforce's RevML and ``vcp`` may be some use but apparently don't go
all the way.

Things like darcs and monotone may have such a different model that it
may be hard to map them.

Two-way sync may require keeping external state and is probably pretty
hard.

Apparently tlord tried to do something about this before but it
stalled.

Eventually perhaps we could arrange for someone to export key
bitkeeper archives in this format, allowing all tools to read them in.

Colin__ points the existing mailing list about this which is just a
bunch of spam.
