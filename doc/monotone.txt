Great project, but not perfect.

My main feeling is that it exposes too much mechanism and in the wrong
ways.  For example, hashes are all very well for representing
identity, but I don't want to see them; I just want to say "r43 of
this branch".  

Cryptographic signing is good for making sure revisions are really
what they claim to be, but I don't want to directly deal with it: I
want it as a check that things are really happening as they should
be.  It should be barely seen and not heard unless/until something
goes wrong.
