ChangeLogs
**********

Changelogs have an interesting relation to version control systems.
They are, for some projects, the primary way of examining history.
They provide a pattern and standard for writing commit history, which
may encourage people to enter more details (function names, etc) in a
systematic way than they otherwise might.  The ChangeLog is available
offline, in tarfiles, or even when the project has been switched into
a different VCS.

GNU ChangeLog format is only the most important, not the only such
file.  Debian uses a different format for packages.  At a higher
level, 

At the same time the information there is some redundancy: both the
ChangeLog and the VCS want to hold the description of what has been
done, including descriptive text, names of files changed, etc.

Some people say__ that ChangeLogs are mostly needed because of the
limitations of CVS (and originally RCS): if it was easy to read the VC
history when disconnected and at local speed, and if there are atomic
commits then they might be needed rather less.

There should be hooks called to create the log message template and
before committing it.  These might, for example, populate it with
space for per-file comments, or check that it is in the right format.
