Partial commit
**************

In the first cut, commit covers the whole tree.

Secondly, people might want to commit only particular files or
subdirectories.  Semantics of this in the case of renames/adds/deletes
may be a bit complex, but I think it can be done.  The basic point is
to build an inventory which includes only the specified changes from
the working copy. 

Beyond that, it can be very nice in darcs to commit only selected
changes to a file.  I think this should not be the default though;
perhaps only do it with ``-i``.  Even better (for some users) kick off
a graphical tool to select the particular regions.  Beyond a certain
point it may become easier for the user to explicitly set aside some
changes and commit others first.

In any case, it is a good idea to run a test suite on the revision to
be committed, to make sure there were no missed dependencies.
