Mirroring
=========

The basic idea of mirroring is good, but it's too hard to understand.

Push mirrors and pull mirrors.

Suggest that people commit to their local machine and then regularly
mirror elsewhere as a backup.

bk and darcs's design inherently avoids this; just make another repo
and decide to use it that way.

On the other hand they do not keep track of the progress of a patch.
