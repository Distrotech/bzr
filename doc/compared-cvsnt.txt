 * SSPI authentication on Windows, and built-in Putty SSH code.

 * Branch ACLs.
 
 * Remote user administration using cvs passwd command.

 * Repository browsing via cvs ls command (update: now provided in
   standard CVS since version 1.12.9)

 * LockServer on a second port replaces filesystem-based locks &
   provides file level locking


Various other improvements relative to CVS, particularly for Windows
users.  Worth looking at, but nothing apparently earth-shaking.

Interesting that the advanced merge support is basically that it
remembers what was pulled across.
