Types of conflict
*****************

The following types of conflict can be encountered during a merge, or
a merge-like operation (such as resyncing local changes with
upstream):

Aaron's list:

* Parent directory missing when attempting to add a file

* Attempt to create directory that already exists

* Some patch hunks failed to apply

* While changing permissions, the "old" permissions in the changeset do
  not match the file.

* While replacing contents of a file, the old contents of a file do not
  match the changeset

* Attempt to remove non-empty directory: This only occurs when the
  directory has contents that it didn't have the last time it was deleted.
  It's pretty easy to handle adds, renames and deletes for exact
  patching.  There's no need to rm -rf directories as tla does.

* Attempt to create a symlink when there is already a file/dir/etc with
  that name

* Attempt to apply a patch to a file that does not exist

* Attempt to remove a file that does not exist

* Attempt to rename a file that does not exist

* Attempt to change permissions of a file that does not exist

* Can't determine filename during three-way merging

* Can't determine file parent directory during three-way merging

* Can't determine file permissions during three-way merging

Aaaron says: I have no doubt there are more.  For example, attempt to
change permissions of a symlink.
