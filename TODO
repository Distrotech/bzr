Todo for groupcompress:

 * layers - gc reader/writer and vf layers should be separate
 * alternate copy/insert encoding?
 * other stuff from design

 * Look at splitting the 'labels' section into a header/index for all
   compressed entries, separate from the actual content. This could potentially
   improve compression efficiency.

 * Consider a more 'binary' layout for things like sha1 sums, or length
   indicators.

 * Investigate sha1 overhead. Currently when doing 'bzr pack' we sha once on
   extraction, and then one more time on insertion. Removing both calls saves
   6s out of 32s for 'bzr pack' (and 8s=>5.5s for 'repository-details')
