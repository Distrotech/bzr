bzr-0.0.3  NOT RELEASED YET

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
      in the tree.

    * Can now say "bzr commit --help".

    * New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
      and/or directory.

    * New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
      directory.

    * Basic "bzr mv" support for renames!  (Not all scenarios work
      through the command at the moment, but the inventory support is
      there.)

    * New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

  CHANGES:

    * .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
      UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
      will do for now.)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
      exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
      Nielsen.

  INTERNAL:

    * Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

    * Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.


bzr-0.0.2.1

  PORTABILITY:

    * Win32 fixes from Steve Brown.


bzr-0.0.2  "black cube"  2003-03-31

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * Default ignore list extended (see bzrlib/__init__.py).

    * Patterns in .bzrignore are now added to the default ignore list,
      rather than replacing it.

    * Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

    * More help topics.

    * Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
      branch.

    * New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
      'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

    * Performance improvements.

    * New global --profile option.
    
    * Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
      the root directory only.

  PORTABILITY:

    * Include a subset of ElementTree-1.2.20040618 to make
      installation easier.

    * Fix time.localtime call to work with Python 2.3 (the minimum
      supported).
