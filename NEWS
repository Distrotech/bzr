bzr-0.0.5  NOT RELEASED YET

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New 'bzr whoami --email' option shows only the email component
      of the user identification, from Jo Vermeulen.

    * New 'bzr ignore PATTERN' command.

    * Nicer error message for broken pipe and similar conditions that
      don't indicate an internal error.

  TESTING:

    * Converted black-box test suites from Bourne shell into Python.
      Various structural improvements to the tests.

  INTERNAL:

    * Included ElementTree library upgraded to 1.2.6 by Fredrik Lundh.


bzr-0.0.4  2005-04-22

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * 'bzr diff' optionally takes a list of files to diff.  Still a bit
      basic.  Patch from QuantumG.

    * More default ignore patterns.

    * New 'bzr log --verbose' shows a list of files changed in the
      changeset.  Patch from Sebastian Cote.

    * Roll over ~/.bzr.log if it gets too large.

    * Command abbreviations 'ci', 'st', 'stat', '?' based on a patch
      by Jason Diamon.

    * New 'bzr help commands' based on a patch from Denys Duchier.


  CHANGES:

    * User email is determined by looking at $BZREMAIL or ~/.bzr.email
      or $EMAIL.  All are decoded by the locale preferred encoding.
      If none of these are present user@hostname is used.  The host's
      fully-qualified name is not used because that tends to fail when
      there are DNS problems.

    * New 'bzr whoami' command instead of username user-email.


  BUG FIXES: 

    * Make commit safe for hardlinked bzr trees.

    * Some Unicode/locale fixes.

    * Partial workaround for difflib.unified_diff not handling
      trailing newlines properly.


  INTERNAL:

    * Allow docstrings for help to be in PEP0257 format.  Patch from
      Matt Brubeck.

    * More tests in test.sh.

    * Write profile data to a temporary file not into working
      directory and delete it when done.

    * Smaller .bzr.log with process ids.


  PORTABILITY:

    * Fix opening of ~/.bzr.log on Windows.  Patch from Andrew
      Bennetts.

    * Some improvements in handling paths on Windows, based on a patch
      from QuantumG.


bzr-0.0.3  2005-04-06

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    * New "directories" internal command lists versioned directories
      in the tree.

    * Can now say "bzr commit --help".

    * New "rename" command to rename one file to a different name
      and/or directory.

    * New "move" command to move one or more files into a different
      directory.

    * New "renames" command lists files renamed since base revision.

    * New cat command contributed by janmar.

  CHANGES:

    * .bzr.log is placed in $HOME (not pwd) and is always written in
      UTF-8.  (Probably not a completely good long-term solution, but
      will do for now.)

  PORTABILITY:

    * Workaround for difflib bug in Python 2.3 that causes an
      exception when comparing empty files.  Reported by Erik Toubro
      Nielsen.

  INTERNAL:

    * Refactored inventory storage to insert a root entry at the top.

  TESTING:

    * Start of shell-based black-box testing in test.sh.

      rather than replacing it.

    * Ignore list isn't reread for every file.

    * More help topics.

    * Reinstate the 'bzr check' command to check invariants of the
      branch.

    * New 'ignored' command lists which files are ignored and why;
      'deleted' lists files deleted in the current working tree.

    * Performance improvements.

    * New global --profile option.
    
    * Ignore patterns like './config.h' now correctly match files in
      the root directory only.
